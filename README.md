## Music File Indexer
Simple python script that reads music files (mp3, m4a and m4v) and summarized in a txt and a csv file.

Subdirectories will be treated recursively to any depth.

The dist folder contains single executables. They can be placed in the root directory of a USB thumbdrive or a TF card.
